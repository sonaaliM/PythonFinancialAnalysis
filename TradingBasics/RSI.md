# Momentum Oscillator 

- works only in range bound markets, else will show extreme fluctuations
- RSI is a Momentum Indicator 
- Invented by J.Welles Wilder(New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems)

# Leading vs Lagging Indication

- Lagging indicators follow prices and leading indicators lead prices 
- Lagging indicators cannot be used to predict stock price movements.
- RSI is leading vs MACD is lagging
- Wilder uses exponential moving average for calculating RSI making it smooth and consistent

# RSI
 - predict price movement - often in advance of the move
 - entry and exit points - buy sell indication
 - Identify Trend - by momentum - up or down movement
 - Identify trend changes or reversal - 
 - Finding Buy Options

# Important Note
- RSI tells when a stock is going strong or weak, indicating when to buy or sell.
- RSI shows the strength of stock/index **RELATIVE** to the historical strength of same stock/index.

# 3 choices in Market

- what to buy
- when to buy
- when to sell

# Challanges of RSI

- Timeframe - Tricks that works in Daily Chart(Wilder) might not work for Weekly Chart(Andrew Cardwell)
- RSI period - RSI can be set to different periods which can give different results e.g 14 days for daily chart
- Depends on Target Market
- Smoothening and Data Length mismatch can give different values for RSI - It can show u a divergence where there is none


# RSI Patterns

- Positive and Negative Reversals(Cardwell) - bullish and bearish divergences
- Price/RSI Divergences(Wilder)

RSI is measured on a scale of 0 to 100

50 : center line
Above 70 : overbought
Below 30 : oversold
Default Period = 14 days

# RSI Calculation Method - The Secret of RSI

**MOMENTUM** == Rate of price rise or fall

RSI is calculated on basis of the closing price of the candle

- 1 min chart = closing price of 1 min
- 1 day chart = Days closing price

**Closing Price** = Fina verdict of the traders for the day

# Important Note

Using RSI in intraday chart is difficult bcoz it relies on closing price of the day

- Example if RSI changes during intraday at important levels, better to wait till last few mins on trading session to confirm tht RSI will not change again significantly
- Why ? Bcoz Markets have gap up methods on next day opening to clear the resistance of stocks

RSI = Ratio of Gains and Losses over period of 14 days

**More gaines Higher the RSI and More Loses Lower the RSI **

- With every GAIN the DOWN Average comes down
- However **UP AVERAGE can also come DOWN** if the **GAINS for the DAY are BELOW UP AVERAGE**

**NOTE** 

- Amount of GAINS and LOSSES is IMPORTANT
  - Example : RSI of stock with 10% GAINS is **HIGHER** than stock with 1% GAINS

- RSI is calculate EXPONENTIALY so the WEIGHTAGE of Todays GAIN/LOSS are Higher than the historical period


# Analysis of RSI calculation

- Flattening of curve - generally seen in over brought and oversold zones 
- bcoz prices are not increasing sharply
- means momentum is not increasing
- rate of positive price change has decreased
- **DOES NOT** mean price reversal immediately but in short term as momentum is declining
- Positive price should be going up consistently if it falls means RSI is flattening
